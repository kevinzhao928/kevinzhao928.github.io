        <h2>My relationship with badminton:</h2>
        <p>I started playing badminton in 2007, when I was 8 years old. It was introduced to me by my parents as I
            was extremely overweight when I was younger. I found badminton to be quite fun as it took my mind off
            golfing. I never trained professionally or had a badminton coach; I just played against people that were
            better than me. By the time I got into highschool I was pretty decent at it. It was in Gym class during 
            badminton where I met my best friend to this day: Raphael Lee. We joined the badminton team and quickly
            formed a close friend group consisting of Raphael, Patrick, Jack, and I. Outside of school we would always
            go to Richmond Pro to practice and play against each other and the 4 of us became the core of our badminton
            team. For the next 3 years, we constantly played against each other and against the best players in Vancouver.
            During my time on the team - from grade 8&rarr;10 we were crowned city champions twice.
        </p>
        <p>After I left Prince of Wales to attend the International Baccalaureate program, I continued to play and was able
            to obtain the City Champions title for my new highschool. The group of players I met at Churchill are nowhere near
            as close as my friends from Prince of Wales however they are still my teammates and I have immense respect and 
            appreciation for everyone on the team.
        </p>
        <p>At university, I do not plan on joining the varsity badminton team however I still play casually on drop-in nights
            and as apart of the University of Waterloo Badminton Club.
