  <h2>Brief Overview</h2>
  <p>I was born as an only child on 13 June 1999 in Los Angeles. Then my family came to Vancouver, British Columbia (BC) Canada where I stayed for kindergarten.
    Following that, we moved back to Wuxi, China where I attended preschool &rarr; grade 2. Then, family moved BACK to Vancouver
    where I stayed for the rest of my education from grade 3 &rarr; grade 12.
  </p><br>
  <h2>Schooling</h2>
  <p>I attended Lord Byng Elementary located in Steveston from grade 3 &rarr; grade 7. It was here where I learned English and how to interact with my fellow classmates. 
    Even though Lord Byng was ranked #900+, I learned valuable cultural values and developed friendships that still last to this day. Catching up with my Lord Byng friends 
    after high-school graduation was truly special.
  </p>
  <p>After grade 6, my family and I moved to Shaughnessy where I attended Shaughnessy elementary school. It was there where I truly started to develop friends that later
    became family. I also had a fanatastic teacher. Ms. Sharon Hann taught grade 7 division 2 at Shaughnessy and my entire classs loved her. Her class was fun and informative.
    She kept a very light environment in her classroom and was extremely supportive of all of her students.
  </p>
  <p>After graduating from Shaughnessy, most of my friends and I attended Prince of Wales secondary (PW). At PW I was involved in the school badminton/golf team from grade 8 &rarr; grade 10.
    Throughout these 3 years, we were able to achieve Vancouver city runner ups in badminton and AAA BC Provincial Champions in Golf. At PW, Mr. Michael Choi, Mr. Nathan Sung, Ms. Birsan, and Mr. Sandor
    were the teachers that stood out. All of them were great teachers but they were also your friends on top of that. The BC school curriculum was quite easy and academics were not a main focus compared to sports
    (more detail in <a href="kz hobbies.html">Hobbies</a>). Most importantly, it was at PW where I met my best friend: Raphael Lee. We met in PE class during badminton and we have been best buds ever since.
    Raphael (Raf) became family to me. He was someone that I can go to for whatever reason. When I was feeling down due to family issues/relationship issues/academic issues Raf would always be there for me and
    vice versa. We are family.
  </p>
  <p>My years at PW ended early as I got into the International Baccalaureate (IB) program at Sir Winston Churchill seoncdary. In IB I took Chemistry, English, History at High Level (HL),
    and Math, Physics, Japanese at Standard Level (SL). HL courses are equivalent to university year 1 and 2 courses whereas the SL courses are a little more advanced than the regular curriculum.
    IB also had a mandatory Creativity, Action, Service (CAS) requirement. It was IB's way of getting IB students to do extracurriculars.
    <ul>
      <div class="cas">
      <li>Creativity - artistic/music/drawing/photography etc</li><br>
      <li>Action - sports</li><br>
      <li>Service - volunteer</li>
    </ul></div>
  </p>
  <p>IB was tough, the curriculum for the HLs especially HL Chemistry was quite difficult. All 120 IB Diploma candidates were subjected to all of IB's many gimmicks and quirks such as Theory of Knowledge (ToK)
    , Extended Essay (EE), and Internal Assessments (IA). ToK was an interesting course; it taught you how to think and how to approach the world with a critical PoV. Overall ToK was fun and interesting however
    it felt like a waste of time when the other courses start to ramp up. The EE was a 4000 world research essay that you start at the end of your first year and finish at the beginning of the second. The EE can be
    written any one of your HL subjects and the entire process is written up and done by the studnet with moderation and guidance from a teacher. As long as you started your EE early you will be fine or just stay
    away from a STEM EE. Lastly, the IAs: the bane of our existence. When IA season hit, it was the most stressful and worst part of IB. IAs are 2000 word research papers for every subject and just like the EE it is
    completely done by the student with moderation of your subjecst teacher. The IAs combined wtih the stress of university applications and mock exams made the end of your second year the busiest time of your
    highscool career. This is where most of the all-nighters occur.
  </p>
  <p>However, IB was not all bad. I got to meet some truly extraordinary people. All of the friends that I made in IB are extremely hard-working and outstanding. Their work ethic is something that 
    I learned and compared myself to. The way they study and approach problem sets is motivating and it acted as a guide for me. From learning through them and comparing myself to them I can confidently say that 
    I am nowhere near their skill level and dedication however they have taught me what outstanding students are like and what I should strive to become throughout my university journey.
