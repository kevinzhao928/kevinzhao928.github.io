        <h2>CS:GO</h2>
        <p>CS:GO is a first person shooter (FPS) game on Steam developed by Valve where the game is split into 2 teams: counter-terrorists
            (CT) and terrorists (T). The most popular game mode is the search and destroy game mode where the objective of
            the Ts is to plant a bomb and blow up the area whereas the CTs want to prevent that from happening. CS:GO is
            well known for its complex strategies and precise momvements in order to succeed. All of the maps are static
            and will not change, this leads to creative uses of utilities such as flashbangs and smoke grenades and as well
            as complex map play. I was able to achieve the highest rank in CS:GO possible: Global Elite - in the top 0.75%
            of all CS:GO players. I was hired to play professionally however the Chinese company that owned the team eventually
            decided to bail on CS:GO and all the players were dropped. During my time on the team we were sponsored with
            the most desirable and expensive weapon skins such as an AWP Dragon Lore and an AK-47 Fire Serpent and well as
            lengendary tier items like Factory New Ruby M9 Bayonets. After being dropped I sold my Steam account along with
            the skins to a wealthy skin collector and stopped playing CS:GO ever since.

        <h2>League of Legends</h2>
        <p>League of Legends (LoL) is a massively online battle arena (MOBA) game where you are placed into a team of 5 and
            the objective is to destory the enemy nexus (base). LoL was one of the first computer games that I played and
            it is something that I play purely for fun with friends. Having a group of friends playing together while trashtalking
            and making jokes is quite enjoyable and relaxing. I am not good at LoL - Gold 5 but I aim to have the most fun
            as possible when I play. In LoL I am a jungle main and I mostly play Kha'Zix, and Kayn. The other champions that
            I play are: Caitlyn, Riven, Syndra, and LeBlanc.
