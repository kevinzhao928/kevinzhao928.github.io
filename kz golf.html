        <h2>This is my relationship with golf:</h2>
        <p>I started playing golf back in 2009 when I was 10 years old. I DESPISED it at first; practice was tough, and I did not see
            any improvement - which made me really frustrated. Golf started to get better for me when I entered highschool,
            in 2012, my golf game got substantially better than before and I was able to find friends from school that played.
            We joined the golf team and discovered what competitive golf was like. Starting from 2012-2016 was where I played
            the best and most golf. Throughout my time at Prince of Wales Secondary, I participated in multiple local tournaments
            hosted by CJGA such as the CN Railway Open. I brought my competitive golf and mindset to my school team where
            I was on the starting lineup every single year. 2015 was where we won the AAA Provincial Championship for Prince
            of Wales and at the time I held a handicap of 8.3. After I started the International Baccalaureate Program, I
            was the team captain of the team however I played a fraction of what I used to. Practicing and playing time took
            a cut for other extracurriculars and academics.
        </p>
        <p>I plan to continue in university as there is a local course that is relatively nearby. If I am able to, I would love
            to join the University of Waterloo Varsity Golf Team and train with them.
        </p>
        <p>Golf was something that I developed a fondess for after I got good at it. And through my struggles with golf, I understood
            various life lessons which I prefer to keep to myself - if you want to know, go train! Trainining and playing
            golf has enabled me to meet and interact with various amazing people. Ranging from retired veterans to young
            professionals; a round of golf is the perfect setting and location for getting to know someone. For example,
            the veteran that I was paired with fought in Afghanistan. As someone who is interested in war history, his narrative
            and perspective is something that doesn't make it to the history books. He talked about how his training was,
            how their barracks and living situation was, and the horrors that they saw on the ground. Golf is an activity
            where you are your playing partners can really get to know each other and make conversation interesting and special.
        </p>
        <h3>A round of golf is a place to socialize and enjoy the company of your playing partners!</h3>
