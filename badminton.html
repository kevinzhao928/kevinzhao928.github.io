      <h2>How I started:</h2>
      <p>I started playing badminton in 2007, when I was 8 years old. It was introduced to me by my parents as I
        was extremely overweight when I was younger. I found badminton to be quite fun as it took my mind off
        golfing. I never trained professionally or had a badminton coach; I just played against people that were
        better than me. By the time I got into highschool I was pretty decent at it. </p>
      <h2>My Bitchmens:</h2>
      <p>It was in Gym class during 
        badminton where I met my best friend to this day: Raphael Lee. We joined the badminton team and quickly
        formed a close friend group consisting of Raphael, Patrick, Jack, and I. Outside of school we would always
        go to Richmond Pro to practice and play against each other and the 4 of us became the core of our badminton
        team. Our location of Richmond Pro combined with the sub-par customer service we they had led to the name Bitchmen Pro.
        For the next 3 years, we constantly played against each other and against the best players in Vancouver.
        During my time on the team - from grade 8&rarr;10 we were crowned city champions twice.</p>
      <p>I plan to continue in university as there is a local course that is relatively nearby. If I am able to, I would love
          to join the University of Waterloo Varsity Golf Team and train with them.</p>
      <h2>How it affected me:</h2>
      <p>Through badminton I met and maintained my closest group of friends. Those that have stood by me through everything.
        The Bitchmens have been by each others sides' through the bad times and good. Everyone has lows in life and it is great to
        know that we all have a group of people that will be there for us when we are down. Special shoutout to Raphael for being family.
