      <h2>League of Legends</h2>
      <p>Ah yes...the classic League of Legends. I play League quite often. League is a game that I don't take that seriously.
        And to be honest, I am not that good at League so I only play ranked till Gold V for the skin then stop. League is just a game
        for me and my friends to chill and chat.</p>
      <h2>Counter Strike: Global Offensive</h2>
      <p>Counter Strike: Global Offensive is a game that I played for quite awhile and pretty seriously. I was able to achieve the highest 
        rank in CS:GO possible: Global Elite - in the top 0.75% of all CS:GO players. I was hired to play professionally however the Chinese 
        company that owned the team eventually decided to bail on CS:GO and all the players were dropped. During my time on the team we were sponsored with
          the most desirable and expensive weapon skins such as an AWP Dragon Lore and an AK-47 Fire Serpent and well as
          lengendary tier items like Factory New Ruby M9 Bayonets. After being dropped I sold my Steam account along with
          the skins to a wealthy skin collector and stopped playing CS:GO ever since.</p>
