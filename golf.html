      <h2>How I started:</h2>
      <p>I started playing golf back in 2009 when I was 10 years old. I DESPISED it at first; practice was tough, and I did
        not see any improvement - which made me really frustrated. Golf started to get better for me when I entered highschool,
        in 2012, my golf game got substantially better than before and I was able to find friends from school that played.</p>
      <h2>Getting better:</h2>
      <p>We joined the golf team and discovered what competitive golf was like. Starting from 2012-2016 was where I played the
        best and most golf. Throughout my time at Prince of Wales Secondary, I participated in multiple local tournaments
        hosted by CJGA such as the CN Railway Open. I brought my competitive golf and mindset to my school team where I was
        on the starting lineup every single year. 2015 was where we won the AAA Provincial Championship for Prince of Wales
        and at the time I held a handicap of 8.3. After I started the International Baccalaureate Program, I was the team
        captain of the team however I played a fraction of what I used to. Practicing and playing time took a cut for other
        extracurriculars and academics.</p>
      <p>I plan to continue in university as there is a local course that is relatively nearby. If I am able to, I would love
        to join the University of Waterloo Varsity Golf Team and train with them.</p>
      <h2>How it affected me:</h2>
      <p>Golf was something that I developed a fondess for after I got good at it. And through my struggles with golf, I understood
        various life lessons. I prefer to keep them to myself however I will what I believe is the most important one - progress
        can come when you are least expecting it. I had a major slump in my performance during the winter of 2015 as I was
        overhauing my long game. I was ready to switch back to my old swing/give up but you have to keep at it. It took me
        about 3-4 months of constant back and forth until suddenly I just "GOT" it. I don't know what/why it happened but
        it did. i experienced first-hand the cliche "Rome wasn't built in a day". Trainining and playing golf has enabled
        me to meet and interact with various amazing people. Ranging from retired veterans to young professionals; a round
        of golf is the perfect setting and location for getting to know someone. For example, the veteran that I was paired
        with fought in Afghanistan. As someone who is interested in war history, his narrative and perspective is something
        that isn't in the history books. He talked about how his training was, how their barracks and living situation was,
        and the horrors that they saw on the ground. Golf is an activity where you are your playing partners can really get
        to know each other - it is the best place to network and socialize whilst having fun.</p>
